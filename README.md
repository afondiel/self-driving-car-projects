# Self-Driving Car Projects

## Overview

I was amazed by this project of [Andrea Palazzi](https://github.com/ndrplz) where he shares all the projects of[ Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd0013).


As a lifelong learner, open-source and free education supporter, I echoed the same for the [Self-Driving Car Specialization](https://github.com/afondiel/Self-Driving-Cars-Specialization) of Faculty of Appied Science and Engineering of [University of Toronto](https://www.autodrive.utoronto.ca/) that I took recently on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/self-driving-cars).

I hope you find this helpful and helps gather more resources around self-driving cars Topics.
